A topic that has sparked debate among the intellectually superior, such as myself. Now, I know what you're thinking, \"Sheldon, why are you so opposed to hand dryers?\" Well, let me tell you, it's quite simple, really. Hand dryers are a waste of time, energy, and resources. They're a relic of a bygone era, a primitive attempt to dry one's hands in a world where we should be embracing the latest advancements in technology.\n\nI mean, think about it. Hand dryers are loud, inefficient, and often leave your hands feeling cold and clammy. And don't even get me started on the germs. You're essentially blowing air around, spreading bacteria and viruses everywhere. It's a breeding ground for illness, I tell you!\n\nNow, I know some of you may be thinking, \"But Sheldon, what about the environmental impact?\" Ah, yes, the environment. Well, let me tell you, hand dryers are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. They're a drain on our planet's resources, and we should be doing everything in our power to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nSo, in conclusion, hand dryers are a relic of the past. We should be embracing the latest advancements in technology, such as air dryers or even better, just using a towel. It's the logical choice, really.", "The bus? Are you kidding me?
